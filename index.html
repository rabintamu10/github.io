		<h2>More about me</h2>
		
		<p style="background-color: lightcyan;">I am a senior, majoring in Computer Information Science (CIS) and minoring on Art. I am originally from country Nepal where Mt. everest is located. My curiosity on photography started when I first came to U.S and saw bunch of snow in Makato. Basically I've never seen that much of snow in my whole life that's why I was so excited. I started capturing my first snow fall and I just fell in love with it since then.   </p>
